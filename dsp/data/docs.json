      "description": "## 1. Dark Mode First\n\nMost templates are built using light colors and later on adapted to dark colors.\n\nThe process of building a dark theme shouldn't be an afterthought - it should be a priority.\n\nDracula UI was created to be a dark-first template, taking in consideration all the complexities and UX challenges that dark mode brings.\n\n## 2. Minimal Context Switch\n\nWe truly believe in the cost of context switching.\n\nYour productivity is affected when you need to switch back and forth between a task. That's why our goal is to reduce that time as much as possible.\n\nDevelopers usually have a hard time to utilize Design Systems and bring them to life, because they need to access different systems and tools.\n\nBy making Dracula UI accessible inside your code editor and by providing code autocompletion, you can be much more productive.\n\n## 3. Modularity, Simplicty, and Portability\n\nOur mission is to unleash the creative potential in every developer. We do that by providing modular components that can be reused and composed to generate patterns.\n\nWe live in a portable world, so why user interfaces should be any different? We are starting small, but we believe that Dracula UI should be available everywhere.\n\nIt is all about simplicity.",
