                    Our mission is to unleash the creative potential in every
                    developer. We do that by providing modular components that
                    can be used to build modern sites faster.

                    Most templates are built using light colors and later on
                    adapted to dark colors. Dark themes shouldn't be an
                    afterthought, they should be a top priority.

                    Don't worry about class names, just use the Visual Studio

                    code editor.

                    All accent colors are tested not only against the WCAG 2.1
                    Level AA spec, but also WCAG Level AAA, which requires a
                    contrast ratio of at least 7:1. This gives you the best
                    readability possible.

                    Gradients are a surprisingly versatile tool. They can
                    introduce depth and dimension to your app. By using one of
                    our well-designed gradients, you can subconsciously lead
                    users toward the focal point.

                    Good legibility is crucial to make sure the users can do
                    their job well and with as little fatigue as possible. You
                    can choose between different monospaced, serif, and
                    sans-serif fonts.
