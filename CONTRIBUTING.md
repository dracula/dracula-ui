# Dracula UI

Here's an overview of the architecture and some useful commands.

## Architecture Overview

- Each component consists of a React component implementation, a CSS stylesheet, and a Figma component.
- Components are stateless and do not ship with JavaScript behavior.
- All styling is done in CSS via CSS variables for maximum reuse and accessibility.

# Folder Structure

- src/styles: Contains the CSS styles for all components, typography, and colors.
- src/components: Contains the React implementation for each component.
- src/base: Contains the base spacing and color helpers.

## Component Design Guidelines

- Please don't include manual style changes in React Components.
- Keep HTML and CSS simple as to not generate long and complex HTML trees.
- Use CSS and especially CSS variables to compose your design, so the final result is as inclusive as possible to a wide range of users.

## Useful Commands and Getting Started

Getting started:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn docs
$ yarn dev
```

## Running Tests

You can run all tests with the following command:
Component tests will be executed with React and Enzyme, which compares rendered components to pre-existing snapshots.

```sh
$ yarn test
```

## Generating Documentation

You can update component documentation in one of two ways:

- a) Update TSDoc definitions that live alongside components
- b) Update `src/<component>/__tests__/<component>.test.tsx`, which will generate examples / docs for the main docs website

```sh
$ yarn docs # generates examples, documentation, and snapshots for each component
```

## Accessing Docs

You can access the documentation portal by running the following command, then visiting [http://localhost:3000] on your browser.

```sh
$ yarn dev
```
