                Nandor was born in 1262 in the country of Al Quolanudar, now
                based in southern Iran. He is a former soldier of the Ottoman
                Empire; during this time he pillaged many villages without
                discrimination and twice turned the Euphrates “red with blood”.
                One village, a utopia that he burned to the ground, would later
                become the birthplace of Nadja, his future vampire roommate.

                Nadja was very disadvantaged during her human life. Her village,
                located on a “beautiful” island with a high snake population,
                was once a utopia, but was burned to the ground by the army of
                an unknown warrior (who would eventually turn out to be her
                future roommate Nandor the Relentless) around 200 years before
                she was born. Only the "stupidest" people were spared and the
                village never recovered, leaving its citizens badly affected by
                famine and poverty.

                According to his roommate Laszlo, Colin “came with the house”
                they reside in. He has lived in the Staten Island residence with
                fellow vampires Laszlo, Nadja and Nandor since the 1970s at
                least. Nandor's former familiar Benjy and his current familiar
                Guillermo have also shared his home. He works in an office and

                conversations. Outside of work hours, Colin gains energy by
